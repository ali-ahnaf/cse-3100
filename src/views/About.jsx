                <p>
                    Our mission is to find loving homes for every cat in our care. We
                    provide medical attention, socialization, and support to match each
                    cat with the best possible family.
                </p>

                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <p>
                    Founded by a small group of volunteers, Purrfect Adoption has grown
                    into a community-focused rescue dedicated to animal welfare and
                    education.
                </p>

                <h3>Our Team</h3>
                <p>
                    A passionate team of volunteers, foster homes, and veterinary
                    partners who help care for the cats and support adopters.
