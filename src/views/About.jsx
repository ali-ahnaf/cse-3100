      <h2>Our mission</h2>
      <p>
          Our mission at Purrfect Adoption is to provide safe, loving homes for cats
          in need.
          <br/> 
          We work to connect adoptable cats with caring individuals and
          families while promoting
          <br/>
          responsible pet ownership and animal welfare.
      </p>

      <h2>Our history</h2>
      <p>
          Purrfect Adoption was founded with a simple goal: to help cats find their
          forever homes.
          <br/>
           What began as a small local initiative has grown into a
          trusted adoption platform dedicated to
          <br/> 
          improving the lives of cats and
          the people who care for them.
      </p>

      <h2>Our team</h2>
      <p>
          Our team is made up of passionate animal lovers, volunteers, and advocates
          who are committed to making
          <br/>
          a positive difference. Together, we work
          tirelessly to ensure every cat receives the care, attention, and love
          they deserve.
