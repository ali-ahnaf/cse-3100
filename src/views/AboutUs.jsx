        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          At Purrfect Adoption Bangladesh, our mission is to connect loving cats with caring families across Dhaka and beyond. 
          We believe every cat deserves a forever home filled with love, care, and companionship. 
          We are dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming stray and abandoned cats in Bangladesh, while also 
          educating the community about responsible pet ownership, animal welfare, and the joys of cat adoption.
        </p>
        <p>
          We work tirelessly to ensure that each cat receives proper veterinary care, vaccinations, 
          socialization, and the love they deserve while waiting for their perfect match. 
          Our team carefully screens potential adopters to ensure the best possible homes for our feline friends, 
          making cat adoption accessible and meaningful in Bangladesh.

        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2015 in Dhaka, Purrfect Adoption began as a small grassroots effort by a group 
          of passionate cat lovers who saw a growing need for animal welfare in Bangladesh. What started in a single 
          foster home in Dhanmondi has grown into a thriving organization that has successfully placed 
          over 2,000 cats into loving homes across Bangladesh, including Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the years, we've expanded our services to include community education 
          programs, affordable spay/neuter clinics, and partnerships with local veterinarians in Dhaka and other cities. 
          Our growth has been fueled by the dedication of our volunteers and the generosity 
          of our supporters who share our vision of creating a compassionate Bangladesh where every cat has a home.
