          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            At Purrfect Adoption, our mission is to find loving, forever homes
            for cats in need. We believe every cat deserves a chance to be
            cherished and cared for by a family that will appreciate their unique
            personality and love them unconditionally.

          <h3>Our History</h3>
          <p>
            Founded in 2024, Purrfect Adoption started with a simple dream: to
            revolutionize the way people adopt cats. What began as a small shelter
            has grown into a thriving community dedicated to rescue, rehabilitation,
            and rehoming of cats. Over the years, we've successfully matched
            thousands of cats with their perfect families.
