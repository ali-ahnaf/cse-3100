      <p className="mb-4">
        Founded in 2020, Purrfect Adoption has successfully placed over 500 cats in loving homes. Our team of dedicated volunteers works tirelessly to ensure each cat receives proper care, medical attention, and socialization before finding their forever home.

        We partner with local shelters and rescue organizations to provide a wide variety of cats for adoption, from playful kittens to mature companions. Our thorough adoption process ensures that each cat is matched with the perfect family, considering factors such as lifestyle, living situation, and experience with pets.
