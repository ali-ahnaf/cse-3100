        <h3>Our History</h3>
        <p>
          Founded in 2010, our organization has been on a passionate journey to rescue and adopt out cats 
          from all walks of life. What started as a small group of cat lovers has now grown into a 
          nationwide network, helping thousands of cats find their forever homes each year. 
          Through tireless efforts and community support, weâ€™ve created a space for feline welfare 
          and awareness to thrive.
